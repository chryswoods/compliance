# Isambard Compliance Access Form

This is a simple react application that implements the compliance access
flowchart for assessing compliance for project applications to access
BriCS services.

This is designed to run as a static website that generates an output
(e.g. PDF) that can be downloaded and submitted as part of a project
application.
